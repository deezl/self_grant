# self_grant
A mod for Minetest Servers that allows players to grant themselves interact by entering a keyword.
Code written by CWz as part of a custom sv_tools (server tools) mod written for his server.
This part is offered as a stand-alone mod for server owners as a way for players to grant themselves
interact after reading rules and typing a keyword into chat. The keyword can be changed by editing the 
"inter_keyword.lua" file.

This mod is offered as completely free, WTFPL.
